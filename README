This is an HTTP 1.1 compliant XML-RPC library for Erlang. It is
designed to make it easy to write XML-RPC Erlang clients and/or
servers. The library is compliant with the XML-RPC specification
published by http://www.xmlrpc.org/.

Prior to using this library you need a recent installation of
Erlang. Get it at http://www.erlang.org/. You furthermore need to
install the xmerl package, version 0.18 or better. Get it at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/sowap/.

In order compile the library you need to update the XMERL_PATH
variable in src/Makefile to point at your xmerl installation.

After this go to the src/ directory and run make to compile.

You are now ready to try the client and server examples in the
examples/ directory.

Do not forget to read doc/xmlrpc.3 (or xmlrpc.txt, xmlrpc.ps,
xmlrpc.pdf) for a detailed API description.
